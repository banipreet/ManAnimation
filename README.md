# ManAnimation
It's a basic animation of a man, whose arm and legs can be rotated, and body can move sideways.
Run 1.py for random movement.
Run 2.py and use arrow keys left and right to move the man left and right, and enter the degree using NUMPAD or normal number keys to enter the angle(in degrees) by which you want to rotated the man's arms or legs and then press enter to rotate it. The numbers entered are pushed onto stack (basically used a list but worked as stack), then when enter is pressed, the stack is popped out and the angle by which the arms and legs need to be rotated is executed.
For 1.py to pause, press ESC button.
